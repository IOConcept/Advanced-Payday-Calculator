# Pay Calculator
The Pay Calculator is a Python program that calculates an employee's total pay based on their hourly rate, 
non-overtime hours worked, overtime hours worked, percentage of eligible hours for incentive pay, and incentive pay value.

How to Use
To use the program, simply run the pay_calculator.py script in a Python environment. The program will prompt the user to enter the following information:

Hourly rate: The employee's hourly rate of pay.

Non-overtime hours worked: The number of hours the employee worked that are not considered overtime.

Overtime hours worked: The number of hours the employee worked that are considered overtime.

Percentage of eligible hours for incentive pay: The percentage of total hours worked that are eligible for incentive pay.

Incentive pay value: The value of each hour of incentive pay.

The program will then calculate the employee's regular pay, overtime pay, and incentive pay, and add them together to get the total pay. 

The results will be displayed on the console.

If any non-numerical values are entered for the user inputs, the program will display an error message and prompt the user to enter a valid input.
