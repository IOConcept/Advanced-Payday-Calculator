# Pay Calculator
This program is a tool to calculate the total pay for a given number of hours worked based on the hourly rate, non-overtime hours worked, overtime hours worked, and percentage of hours eligible for incentive pay. The program also allows the user to adjust the hourly rate based on incentive pay by adding a user-entered value for incentive pay.

Getting Started
To use the program, follow these steps:

Open the Python script pay_calculator.py.

Enter the hourly rate, non-overtime hours worked, overtime hours worked, incentive percentage, and incentive pay value when prompted.
The program will calculate the regular pay, overtime pay, incentive pay, and total pay based on the input values.
The program will display the results in the console.

Example Usage
Enter hourly rate: 15.31
Enter number of non-overtime hours worked: 80
Enter number of overtime hours worked: 40
Enter percentage of eligible hours for incentive pay: 50
Enter incentive pay value: 4.00
Regular pay: $1224.80
Overtime pay: $917.25
Incentive pay: $338.65
Total pay: $2480.70

In this example, the user entered an hourly rate of $15.31, worked 80 non-overtime hours and 40 overtime hours, had 50% of their hours eligible for incentive pay, and entered an incentive pay value of $4 per hour. The program calculated a regular pay of $1224.80, an overtime pay of $917.25, an incentive pay of $338.65, and a total pay of $2480.70.
